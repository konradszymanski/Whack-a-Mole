# Whack-a-Mole
Generation.org project - reaction testing. 

Reaction Testing\
Write an HTML/JavaScript 'Whack a Mole'/'Reaction testing'  game\
Have a 'mole' pop out of a (random) hole (on a 10 by 10 grid)\
Measure the time it takes to whack the mole (click on it)\
HINT: t = performance.now();\
You might also want to look at setTimeOut()\
and the onclick attribute/event of your 'mole'\
CSS Position:absolute , left and top  may also be helpful\
Allow 1 second between, 10 turns\
End by displaying the sum and average of the reaction times\
(the time the mole was visible but not clicked)
